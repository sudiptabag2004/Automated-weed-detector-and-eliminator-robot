## Automated Weed Detector and Eliminator Robot

This project focuses on the development of an Automated Weed Detector and Eliminator Robot, combining robotics, machine learning, and computer vision to optimize agricultural processes by identifying and removing weeds efficiently.

### Key Features
- **Weed Detection:** Utilizes a machine learning model trained on a specialized dataset to distinguish weeds from crops.
- **Targeted Action:** The robot performs precise weed elimination, minimizing crop damage.
- **Automation:** Reduces manual labor and enhances productivity in farming.

### Dataset
The dataset used for training the model is publicly available and can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SVInFL3UF56uF4UUeGkKD6TV5KORNC0C?usp=sharing).

### Machine Learning Model
The trained machine learning model is not included in this repository. To obtain the model, please contact the repository owner directly.

### How It Works
1. **Image Acquisition:** The robot captures images from the field.
2. **Weed Classification:** The ML model processes the images to identify weeds.
3. **Elimination:** The robot takes targeted action to eliminate the weeds.

### Contribution
Contributions to enhance functionality, improve detection accuracy, or expand the dataset are welcome!
